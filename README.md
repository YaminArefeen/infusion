Example code for "INFusion: Diffusion Regularized Implicit Neural Representations for 2D and 3D accelerated MRI reconstruction" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13895).  

This code does not exactly replicate the figures, but provides the code used to generate the 2D reconstructions.

To run the code, please download the data and network at the following link: https://utexas.box.com/s/zk5ovid18zoyja5xyurginzq7ihdpep4.

The code also requires the BART MRI Toolbox (https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/) in Python to compute coil sensitivity maps.
